# Graph-Convolutional-Neural-Network-with-Pytorch

In this notebook i implemented graph convlution neural network model for graph classification on MUTAG dataset

I simplifed each step to be welll understood then put all toghether in a class modules then used pytorch lightining for training.

# MUTAG Dataset

The dataset we will use below is called the MUTAG dataset. It is a common small benchmark for graph classification algorithms, and contain 188 graphs with 18 nodes and 20 edges on average for each graph. The graph nodes have 7 different labels/atom types, and the binary graph labels represent “their mutagenic effect on a specific gram negative bacterium” (the specific meaning of the labels are not too important here). The dataset is part of a large collection of different graph classification datasets
